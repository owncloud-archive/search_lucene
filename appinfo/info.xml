	<description>Activate this app when you want to be
		able to find files by searching their content.
		The implementation does not search the files
		directly but will build a reverse index based on lucene.

		Currently only your personal files will be indexed,
		and only your index is searched, so you will not be able
		to find files that have been shared with you or that
		reside on remote mount points.

		Every time a file has been written ownCloud will
		index it with a background job. Furthermore, when
		clicking the search box it will check if any
		files need indexing. It might take a while to build
		the index after first enabling this app,
		depending on the amount of files you have.

		Even thought file indexing is in progress you will
		still be able to retrieve file search results for any
		indexed files.

		We currently support text, latex, HTML, PDF, MS Office 2007
		or newer and Open/Libre Office files.

		Depending on the file size and version of PDF / office files
		indexing may fail. This is a known issue and help is welcome
		to get these problems reproduced and sorted out.
